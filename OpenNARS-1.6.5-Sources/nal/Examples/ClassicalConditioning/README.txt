get classical conditioning right.
TODO: make timing correct..


example (forward conditioning, extinction):

innate goal/instinct: "if cheese is here, eat it" (unconditioned stimulus and response)
<<{cheese} --> [here]> =|> (^eat,cheese)>!
"light gets switched on" (neutral stimulus)
<{light} --> [on]>. :|:
"cheese is served" (unconditioned stimulus)
<{cheese} --> [here]>. :|:

a day later..
"light gets switched on" (is now a conditioned stimulus due to the observation based association)
<{light} --> [on]>. :|:

because of the observation, namely
that after the switching on of the light, cheese is served, cheese gets predicted:
OUT: <{cheese} --> [here]>. :/:
and to the right time where it is expected,
the now conditioned response, "eating cheese" is triggered: (decision making)
OUT: EXECUTE (^eat,cheese)

some seconds later:
oh cheese didn't come, disappointment causes anticipation:
"cheese does not come when light is on" (extinction)
(--,<<{light} --> [on]> =/> <{cheese} --> [here]>>). :|:  
and causes revision which updates the trusthworthyness of the hypothesis, with the result:
"it is possible that cheese is served when the light gets switched on, but it is only the case about half of the time"
